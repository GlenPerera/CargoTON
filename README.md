# React + TypeScript + Vite

The project is based on creating a website for CargoTon Company. For the project,
I have used react and vite as the build tool and also for the styling I used tailwind css and for adding more interactions in the webpafge I have used Javascript.

The website is fully responsive.
To run :
type on terminal-
1) cd CargoTon
2)npm install
3)npm run dev
